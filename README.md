## Description

This is my final project, called our "Breakable Toy", for Launch Academy. Launch Academy is an intensive coding bootcamp for learning web development, focusing on the Ruby on Rails framework.

WorkIt allows users to quickly and easily log their workouts while they're at the gym. I used OmniAuth to allow a user to login using Devise, Google, or Fitbit if they want to incorporate Fitbit data into the app. I used Reactjs elements to provide a smoother user experience. If the user logs in with Fitbit, they can see the average of their last week of steps. A user can also see their data displayed on a graph using Google Charts.
